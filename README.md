# 📊 Breast Cancer Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores diagnostic breast cancer data to identify key tumor features that distinguish malignant from benign cases. Using **statistical analysis, SQL queries, and visualization in R**, it highlights the strong predictive power of tumor size metrics in cancer diagnosis.

## 🔍 Methods  
- **Data Exploration**: Summarized tumor size (radius, area, perimeter) across diagnosis groups.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Generated full correlation matrices and heatmaps to reveal feature relationships.  
- **Group Comparison**: Compared malignant vs. benign correlations and distributions.  
- **Statistical Testing**:  
  - Pearson correlation between tumor size and diagnosis (r ≈ 0.73).  
  - Welch’s t-test confirming significant mean size differences (p < 2.2e-16).  

## 📈 Key Findings  
- Malignant tumors have significantly larger mean radius (≈17.5) than benign tumors (≈12.1).  
- Tumor radius, area, and perimeter are highly correlated with malignancy.  
- Correlation structures differ between malignant and benign groups, suggesting unique tumor morphology patterns.  

## 🛠 Tools  
- **R**: dplyr, ggplot2, corrplot  
- **SQL**: data querying & preprocessing  
- **Techniques**: correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization  

## Impact
The results confirm that tumor morphology metrics are strong predictors of malignancy, providing a foundation for future predictive modeling and early cancer detection research.
